"""Animated terminal scenes.

A terminal on screen has to *move*, or it reads as a screenshot of a terminal.
This builds a frame sequence showing commands typing out character by character,
then their real captured output appearing.

    terminal_scene(
        scene_id="install",
        title="Installing Wagtail",
        bar="Windows . PowerShell",

            Cmd(text='pip install "wagtail==7.4.3"',

        ],
        say="...",
    )

Output is real: paste what the command actually printed. Inventing terminal
output in a teaching video is how viewers end up chasing a result that never
happens on their machine.
